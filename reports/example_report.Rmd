This is an example `Rmarkdown` report produced through a workflow built on the `targets` framework, made portable using `renv`, and ran manually or automatically using `GitHub Actions`. In this example, we show a data quality check workflow report for a nutrition survey of children 6-59 months old.

## Data

```{r}
mtcars_clean
```

## Model
